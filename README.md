# availity-billing-autofiller

A small project where I implemented a program to automate my billing process for work given a singular data point.

For some background: I act as a data administrator for a pharmacy and was recently tasked with streamlining specific billing processes. The program in this repository did just that!

While crucial data points are missing in order to make this program fully automated, I managed to cut the process by five times the normal amount of time. This has saved the company many long hours that would have been spent on a tedious task.
